With so many excellent monospace fonts on the market, designed by professional designers and looking neat and beautiful, it's surprising how many fall short when I actually use them for coding. I've found myself consistently dissatisfied with certain aspects, for example:

- _JetBrains Mono_ has a refined glyph design and uniform layout, but its style feels a bit too rigid.
- _Fira Code_ has rich ligatures, but it lacks italics, and the automatically generated italic angle is too steep.
- _Victor Mono_ features a cursive-style italic, but its slightly exaggerated style isn't quite to my taste.
- _Sarasa Gothic_ offers a 2:1 monospace ratio for Chinese and English, but the English portion feels too narrow, impacting readability.
- Very few monospace fonts have rounded corners.
- Very few monospace fonts prioritize support for Nerd-Font and Chinese characters.

Therefore, I created this font with clean glyphs, a cursive-style italic, fine-grained configuration, built-in Nerd-Font, and a 2:1 monospace ratio for Chinese and English. I create it to enhance my working experience, and hope that it can be useful to others.
